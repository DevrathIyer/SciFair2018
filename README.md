## Analysing Amazon product Reviews
This used to be a project from Fayimora, but I've since appropriated it for my 2018 science fair project.

It uses Tf-IDF topic modelling to extract topics from short amazon reviews, then uses Dependency Parsing, Sentiment Analysis, POS tagging, and Open IE to generate rich insights from only plaintext data. It's pretty cool!





Please don't steal it.
